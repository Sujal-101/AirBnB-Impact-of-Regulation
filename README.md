## Overview :

It includes detailed information about hosts, pricing, locations, room types, and over 5 million historical guest reviews. The dataset provides valuable insights for studying trends in the short-term rental market.

## Dataset :

- listings.csv
Contains detailed information about Airbnb properties, including host details, location, pricing, and room types.
- reviews.csv
Includes guest reviews for Airbnb properties, covering feedback, review dates, and reviewer details.

## Insights :
1. Initially, both the number of AirBnBs and their prices increased due to early traction and interest from early adopters.
2. As AirBnB became widely known and commonly used, the number of listings continued to grow, but prices started to decline.
3. Around 2015, following the announcement of regulations, uncertainty grew in the market. This led to a decrease in the number of AirBnBs and a rise in prices.
4. By 2019, once the regulations became the norm, the number of AirBnB listings increased again, resulting in prices decreasing due to higher supply.
   
## Recommendation :
1. Regulations on long-term rentals can negatively affect the business by causing both customer and host churn due to increased uncertainty.
2. Such regulations may lead to financial losses for AirBnB, which could be difficult to recover from in the future.
3. If customer experience is impacted, it may result in a negative brand perception.
4. It is advisable to monitor similar regulations in other regions and prepare accordingly.
5. AirBnB can anticipate and adapt to these regulations as they arise in different locations.
6.Implementing strict rules for onboarding and removing hosts can help maintain quality control.
7. Limiting the number of AirBnBs in a specific area could ensure enough rental options for the public and potentially prevent government intervention.
